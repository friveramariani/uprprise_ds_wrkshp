# Important terminology for the workshop

- **epicycle**: a cycle that moves around a larger cycle[@dspeng]
- **programming script**: file containing a series of lines of codes that are executable for specific tasks[@wikiscript]
- **repository**: central storage system (in our case online) for scripts, data, and documents [click here for more information](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-repository)
- **algorithm**: a set of rules or processess with a script. A script file coult have a single or more than one algorithim. 
- **dataset**: file containing the variables, and the observations (e.g. values) for each variable, to be examined in the data analysis workflow[@tidydata]
- **variable**: contains the measures underlying an attribute. Example, the **age* variable would only contain the age of a person in years (sometimes in month)[@tidydata]
- **observation**: measure within a variable arranged in the same unit[@tidydata]
- **uncleaned (or unstructured) data**:
- **cleaned (or structured) data**: dataset that contains no errors, inacurate data points, incomplete annotations, or irrelevant data (i.e. data not needed for downstream analysis). Different types of dataset require specific approaches to become structured (e.g. cleaned)[@dspeng]
- **tidy data**: the data is arranged that each column is a variable, and each row is an observsation[@tidydata]
- **package (or library)**: units, in the case of the R language, that contain resuable R functions, include documentation, examples, and often, samples of data to implement the functions. 
- **version control**: the approach of saving every version of a giving file, document, etc. In many platforms that implement version control each gets a unique identifier
